# TQL
TESS Quick Look light curve plot generator


## Data
* TESS tpf are downloaded from MAST via `lightkurve` package
* SDSS2 Red image with superposed TESS aperture (yellow) and Gaia sources (red squares) within roughly the same FOV as TESS postage stamp is shown for comparison (see QL figure below)


## Method
* given the coordinates of the cluster member from the table, TESS tpf file is searched using [`search_targetpixelfile`](https://docs.lightkurve.org/api/lightkurve.search.search_targetpixelfile.html#lightkurve.search.search_targetpixelfile)
* checks if the target happens to be flagged as [TOI](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/tess-data-alerts/#dataaccess); TOI number is indicated in the created figure, filename, and `kurasta.log`
* aperture photometry, systematics correction (optional use of PLD or SFF), period search (using TLS), and phase-folding are all done using [lightkurve](https://github.com/KeplerGO/lightkurve) and [transit least squares (TLS)](https://github.com/hippke/tls.git) packages 
* [TLS results](https://transitleastsquares.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python%20interface.html#return-values) are also used for ranking signal detections

## Notes
* TOI are queried from [TESS Alerts](https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/download_toi.php?sort=toi&output=csv) though some RA and DEC (e.g. TOI-144) are not precise enough to match a TPF using `lightkurve.search_targetpixelfile.`
* breakpoints based on [data release notes](http://archive.stsci.edu/tess/tess_drn.html) are manually encoded
* About `lightkurve`:
  - tpf was downloaded with `quality_bitmask='hardest'` so all flagged data is removed, although some obvious bad data can still show up ([here](https://github.com/jpdeleon/kurasta/blob/master/tics_in_star_clusters/Hyades/TIC399697011.png) for example); try also `hard/default` to be less conservative; [see meaning of flags here](https://github.com/KeplerGO/lightkurve/blob/master/lightkurve/utils.py#L174)
  - `tpf.to_lightcurve().remove_nans().remove_outliers().normalize()` is likely very conservative but there can be remaining obvious outliers after checking preliminary results
  - pipeline was run in all known TOIs (see TOI folder) to test its effectiveness; only deep transits were recovered  
  - `tpf.to_corrector().correct()` is almost always necessary to detect signals in known TOIs
  - only `PLD` is available for TESS tpf with order=2 by default (n=1 uses only the pixel fluxes to construct the design matrix; higher order populates the design matrix with columns constructed from the products of pixel fluxes); see details [here](https://github.com/KeplerGO/lightkurve/blob/master/lightkurve/correctors/pldcorrector.py)
  - other generic periodogram can be used e.g. [BLS](https://docs.lightkurve.org/api/periodogram.html?highlight=periodogram)
* TOI with RV e.g. HARPS are cross-matched with existing database using [`archive_digger`](https://github.com/jpdeleon/archive_digger)


## To do
* implement vetting procedure in sec 2.3 of [Heller+2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09038.pdf)
  - SDE>9
  - odd_even_mismatch < 3Ïƒ
* analyze TIC 410214986 (TOI 200.01): young DS Tuc system (40 Myr Tucana-Horologium young moving group)
* test masking of transit e.g. toi433
* take note of [rolling bands](https://docs.lightkurve.org/tutorials/04-identify-rolling-band.html) in TESS, if there is any, which may be solved with background subtraction
* add filters in arg
* find additional planets by iterative masking of transit
* use Gaia DR2 info (e.g. parallax, pm, rv) as cluster membership constraints
* use web tess viewing tool (wtv.py) to double check if target is (already) observed
  - e.g. https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/tess/webtess/wtv.py?Entry=04+47+42.0%2C+26+09+00
* future search for planets in young systems:
  - HD 283869/ EPIC 248045685: (71.9250, 26.1500)
  - V830 Tau: (68.2918, 24.5620)
  - TAP 26: (64.7167, 17.3881)
  - CI TAU: (68.4667, 22.8417)
* add -cadence arg in a new script for long cadence FFI data with using [eleanor](http://adina.feinste.in/eleanor/index.html) package
* use [TESS notebooks](https://github.com/spacetelescope/notebooks/tree/master/notebooks/MAST/TESS) as guide
* check jgagneastro/finder_charts.py
* orient image properly to to show easy comparison with panel 1 and 2 (currently image is simply inverted!)
* for those with obvious systematics or stellar variability that is not easy to filter ([here](https://github.com/jpdeleon/kurasta/blob/master/tics_in_star_clusters/Hyades/TIC245833065.png) for example), try running `tpf.to_corrector(method='pld').correct(aperture_mask='pipeline', pld_order=2, use_gp=False/True)` i.e. with and without gp; both methods take t>20 minutes to run using my puny laptop
* `aperture_mask='pipeline` for aperture photometry should be customized if needed


## Issues
* DEC axis in archival FOV image with superposed aperture mask shows wrong scale: only few arcsecond across, but Gaia source positions look correct

  - proper motion and radial velocity
  - HRD per cluster from Gaia DR2 (see paper)
  - distributions of host star properties (Teff, Rstar, logg, etc.)

## Animation of cluster members
* Space motion using Gaia DR2 of some clusters are simulated here for t=[-500,500]yr [here](./notebooks). For example: 
![](./notebooks/Pleiades_propermotion.gif)


## Questions
* What do we know about known cluster planets and their host stars?
* Can we constrain Prot using Teff,Rs,logg, etc. from Gaia DR2?
* Does adding prior on stellar rotation period per cluster help model stellar variability better?
* Does using gp built in everest pipeline correct raw/SAP TESSS light curves as input?
* Does masking transits in TOI improve correction (does not cause overfitting)?
